/*** ----------------------------------------- Coroutines ----------------------------------------------
 * Coroutines are lightweight threads that allow you to write asynchronous code as if it were sequential,
 * making it easier to read and maintain.
 *
 * Why Use Coroutines?
 * âœ… Non-blocking by default
 * âœ… Lightweight (thousands of coroutines can run on a few threads)
 * âœ… Structured concurrency
 * âœ… Easy to cancel and manage

 * Builder	             Description
 * launch	      -      Starts a new coroutine, doesn't return result

 * MainScope(): useful in Android for UI-related tasks
