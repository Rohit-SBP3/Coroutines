üî∑ 1. viewModelScope
What it is: A coroutine scope tied to the ViewModel.
Auto-cancelled when the ViewModel is cleared (usually when the screen is destroyed).
Use it for: Anything related to UI logic/data fetching that should live as long as the ViewModel.

‚úÖ Example:
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    fun fetchData() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
           val data = repository.getData()
           // update LiveData or StateFlow
        }
    }
}

‚úÖ Automatically cancels when ViewModel is cleared.
‚úÖ No memory leaks.
‚úÖ Ideal for making network calls, DB fetch, etc.

üî∑ 2. lifecycleScope
What it is: A coroutine scope tied to a LifecycleOwner (like an Activity or Fragment).
Auto-cancelled based on the component's lifecycle state.
Use it for: UI tasks that only need to live while the UI is visible or active.

‚úÖ Example in Fragment:
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
          lifecycleScope.launch {
              val data = fetchSomeData()
              // update UI
          }
    }
}

üîÑ Lifecycle-aware variants:
lifecycleScope.launchWhenCreated { ... }
lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted { ... }
lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed { ... }
