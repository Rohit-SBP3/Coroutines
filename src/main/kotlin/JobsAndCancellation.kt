// Deferred Inherits Job (def have return object)

/*** Job Hierarchy:- Parent-Child Relationship
 * In Kotlin Coroutines, when you launch a coroutine inside another coroutine's scope,
 * the newly launched coroutine becomes a child of the parent coroutine's Job.
 * This forms a tree-like structure â€” hence the term Job hierarchy.
 *
 * ðŸ”— Parent-Child Relationship
 * The parent Job keeps track of all its child Jobs.
 * If a parent coroutine is cancelled, all child coroutines are cancelled automatically.
 * If a child fails (throws exception), by default the parent also gets cancelled (in launch).
 *
